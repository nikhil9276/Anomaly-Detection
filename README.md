                Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data
This repository contains code for detecting anomalies in time series data using Python. The project includes various components such as data preparation, visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and anomaly detection using a Random Forest classifier.

Project Overview
Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial for identifying unusual patterns that could indicate important events, errors, or changes in the system. This project provides a comprehensive approach to anomaly detection, leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy and interpretability.

Components
1. Data Preparation
The first step involves reading and organizing time series data and anomaly labels from CSV files. This ensures the data is in a suitable format for subsequent analysis and modeling.

Steps:
Reading Data: Load the time series data and anomaly labels using pandas.
Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing values to maintain data integrity.
Merging Data and Labels: Combine the time series data with the anomaly labels to create a unified dataset.
2. Visualization
Visualization helps in understanding the data by identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies. This project includes various plots to illustrate the time series data and highlight anomalies.

Steps:
Plotting Time Series Data: Use matplotlib or seaborn to create plots of the time series data.
Highlighting Anomalies: Enhance the plots by marking the anomalies, making them easily identifiable.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves computing basic statistical information about the data to gain insights and understand its structure.

Steps:
Statistical Summary: Compute summary statistics to describe the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset’s distribution.
Distribution of Values: Plot the distribution of time series values to understand their range and frequency.
Anomaly Distribution: Analyze the distribution of anomalies over time to identify patterns.
4. Anomaly Detection
The core of the project involves detecting anomalies using a Random Forest classifier. This includes feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

Steps:
Feature Engineering: Create new features from the time series data to improve model performance.
Splitting Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance.
Training the Model: Train a Random Forest classifier on the training data.
Evaluating the Model: Assess the model’s accuracy and performance using metrics like accuracy score and confusion matrix.
Feature Importance Analysis: Determine the most important features contributing to the anomalies.
Summary Log
The results and outputs are logged to a summary file for record-keeping and further analysis. This includes accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and feature importance values.
