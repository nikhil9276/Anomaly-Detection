                                             Time Series Anomaly Detection

   This repository contains code for detecting anomalies in time series data using Python. It includes the following components:

 1. Data Preparation: Reading time series data and anomaly labels from CSV files.
2. Visualization: Plotting the time series data with anomalies highlighted.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Computing basic statistical information about the data.
4. Anomaly Detection: Identifying potential root causes using feature importance analysis with a Random Forest classifier.
